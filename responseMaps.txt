Performance was quite adequate in all our tests. Are you running\nany other processes in the background?

expensive
The cost of our product is quite competitive. Have you looked around\nand really compared our features?
installation
The installation is really quite straight forward. We have tons of\nwizards that do all the work for you. Have you read the installation\ninstructions?
memory
If you read the system requirements carefully, you will see that the\nspecified memory requirements are 1.5 giga byte. You really should\nupgrade your memory. Anything else you want to know?

We take Linux support very seriously. But there are some problems.\nMost have to do with incompatible glibc versions. Can you be a bit\nmore precise?

Ahhh, BlueJ, yes. We tried to buy out those guys long ago, but\nthey simply won't sell... Stubborn people they are. Nothing we can\ndo about it, I'm afraid.
